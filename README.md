_I also solve problems, just like Mr. Wolf._

Hello! I'm Fabio, Ruby on Rails Fullstack Developer since 2011, eager to learn new stuff everyday, including one random article in wikipedia per day which gives my brain a memory leak.

I ~~hate~~ love solving problems, they have been my obsession since I was a little kid when I started trying to fix eletronic toys with my father's soldering iron. Of course I just ended melting all of those circuit boards.

I've worked as UI/UX Designer as well when I was at [locomotiva.pro](https://github.com/locomotivapro), so a lot of my work comes with design perspective.

Nowadays, I work as Tech Lead and Fullstack developer at [Caiena,](https://github.com/caiena).
